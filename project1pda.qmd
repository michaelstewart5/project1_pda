# Introduction

This project, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Brett Romano Ely and Dr. Matthew Ely from Providence College, examines the effects of environmental conditions on marathon performance across age and gender. The dataset includes performances from five major marathons (Boston, New York, Chicago, Twin Cities, Grandma's) with detailed environmental data such as temperature, humidity, WBGT, and air quality, for athletes aged 14 to 85.

Through exploratory data analysis, we aimed to investigate three main objectives: first, to assess the effects of aging on marathon performance in men and women; second, to explore how environmental conditions such as temperature and air quality affect performance; and third, to identify which specific environmental factors, including WBGT and temperature, have the greatest impact on performance. Hypotheses suggest that older athletes and women may experience more significant declines in performance under adverse conditions. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA and correlation analysis, were employed to examine these relationships and provide insight into the interaction between age, gender, and environmental factors in endurance performance.

# Methods

## Missing Data Handling

Missing weather data were addressed through a complete case analysis, removing rows with missing values for key environmental variables, such as wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature, relative humidity, and air quality (ozone PPM). The proportion of missing data was minimal, accounting for only 4.25% of total observations, as shown in **Table 0**. For instance, in 2011, the Chicago marathon had 126 missing observations (1.09%), New York had 131 (1.13%), and Twin Cities had 118 (1.02%). Duluth (Grandmaâ€™s) marathon in 2012 had 116 missing values (1.00%). Given the relatively small percentage of missing data, this approach ensured the integrity of the data set while avoiding unnecessary complexity in imputation.

## Data Preparation

The dataset comprised marathon performance data from five major races with corresponding environmental conditions, including air quality measures. First, the marathon performance data were merged with course records, race dates, and air quality data. The primary air quality variable, ozone PPM, was calculated as an 8-hour average for each race-year to assess potential impacts of air quality on performance. This calculation ensured that ozone levels were consistently measured across different races and years, providing a standardized metric for air quality comparison.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) focused on the relationship between marathon performance and the variables of interest: age, gender, and environmental conditions. Marathon times were analyzed using summary statistics and visualizations, such as boxplots, to explore trends across different age groups and genders. This analysis provided insights into how performance varied with age, with comparisons made across men and women.

## Statistical Analysis

To assess the effects of environmental variables and demographic factors on marathon performance, a series of ANOVA models were employed. These models examined the influence of gender, age, and race-day flag conditions on performance times. Post-hoc Tukey tests were performed to identify significant pairwise differences across these groups. Interaction effects were also investigated between age and gender, as well as between age and flag conditions.

# Results

## Aim 1: Effects of Increasing Age on Marathon Performance in Men and Women

The analysis of marathon performance across age groups and genders reveals clear trends regarding how marathon times are affected by aging.

As shown in **Figure 1.1**, marathon times are fastest among runners in the 26-35 age range across all five major marathons. Both men and women exhibit slower times as they age, with performance declining progressively in the older age groups. The gender differences are evident, with men generally running faster than women at all ages. Notably, the gap between male and female performance becomes more pronounced in the older age categories, particularly among runners aged 56-64 and 65+, where women tend to take significantly longer to complete the marathon compared to men. Variability in times also increases as participants age for both sexes.

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), legend.position = "bottom")

```


**Table 1.1**, summarizing marathon performance by age and sex, further illustrates these trends. For instance, among 26-35 year olds, male marathoners averaged 139.4 minutes (SD = 10.1), while female marathoners averaged 162.8 minutes (SD = 15.4). This pattern persists across all age groups, and by the 65+ category, men were completing marathons in an average of 276 minutes (SD = 67.6) compared to womenâ€™s 318.1 minutes (SD = 63.3). This nearly 42-minute difference shows the increasing performance gap as athletes age.

The ANOVA results (**Table 1.2**) show that both age and sex have statistically significant effects on marathon times (p \< 0.001). The interaction between age and sex is also significant (p \< 0.001), indicating that the rate of performance decline with age differs between men and women. This interaction is further explored in the Tukey post-hoc analysis (**Table 1.3**), which shows that men outperform women across all age groups, with the largest differences observed in the oldest categories.

Further analysis, as visualized in **Figure 2**, shows that peak performance age varies between men and women across different races. In Boston and Chicago, women tend to reach their peak performance slightly earlier than men, with women peaking in their late 20s and men peaking around age 29. However, in Duluth (Grandmaâ€™s), women reach their fastest marathon times at a later age (36 years old), while men peak at age 30. In New York and Twin Cities, the difference in peak performance age between men and women is minimal, with both sexes peaking around 30. One similarity across the races is that the 26-35 age bin represents the period of fastest marathon times for both men and women, showing that that is the most competitive and fastest group for both genders across all five marathons.

In summary, these results support the hypothesis that aging impacts marathon performance differently for men and women. Both men and women experience declines in performance as they age, but women tend to reach their peak performance at a younger age than men and show a steeper decline in the older age groups. These findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between age and sex in endurance performance for long-distance running events.

## Aim 2

For Aim 2, the goal was to determine how environmental factors influence marathon performance and whether these effects differ by age and gender. One of the primary exploratory analyses involved plotting marathon times against age, stratified by race and gender (Figure 1). Across all races, men tended to perform better overall, with faster marathon times, while older age groups exhibited a clear deterioration in performance for both sexes. The impact of age was most striking in the 65+ group, where times for both men and women increased significantly, especially under less favorable weather conditions (as illustrated in Figure 5).

To better understand these patterns, we assessed marathon times under various flag conditions (representing different environmental challenges) and stratified by age bin. The results showed that younger runnersâ€”particularly in the 18-25 and 26-35 age groupsâ€”were more resilient to adverse weather conditions (i.e., red flag and yellow flag), while older runners, especially those in the 65+ age group, saw larger variations in their performance depending on the environmental conditions (Figure 6).

For example, in the 65+ age group, marathon times under red flag conditions (indicating severe weather) were substantially slower than under green flag conditions (indicating ideal weather). This trend was evident across multiple races, suggesting that older runners are significantly more affected by extreme weather conditions compared to younger age groups. The ANOVA results (Table: ANOVA Results for Marathon Times by Flag Condition, Gender, and Age Bin) confirmed significant interactions between age and environmental conditions, emphasizing that both age and gender modulate the relationship between weather and performance.

Additionally, Duluth (Grandmaâ€™s) stood out as an anomaly among the races due to its summer scheduling. With 50% of its races occurring under yellow flag conditions (Figure 7), Duluth presented runners with consistently higher WBGT values (18.65Â°C on average) compared to marathons like Boston or New York, which had WBGT values of 11.32Â°C and 10.74Â°C, respectively (Table: Marathon Dates with Average WBGT and Runner Count). This higher heat stress environment disproportionately affected older age groups, while younger runners demonstrated more resilience.

## Aim 3

For Aim 3, the analysis shifted from comparing the effects of environmental conditions across demographic groups to identifying which specific weather variables had the most significant impact on overall marathon performance. As shown in the correlation heatmap (Figure 3), WBGT and dry bulb temperature were the most impactful environmental variables, but their correlations with marathon times were modest (around 0.10 for WBGT and DBT in some races). Given the relatively low correlations with other variables like solar radiation and dew point, WBGT emerged as the primary continuous measure of environmental stress, while flag conditions were used as a categorical measure for weather severity.

The bar plot showing correlations by race (Figure 4) highlighted the variation in these relationships across different marathons. For instance, Boston exhibited a 0.10 correlation between marathon times and DBT, while Duluth and Chicago had slightly higher correlations between WBGT and performance. These relatively small correlation values suggested that no single environmental variable had a dominant effect on marathon times, but WBGT consistently emerged as the most relevant continuous measure.

Moreover, the Tukey Post-Hoc Comparisons for Flag Conditions (Table: Tukey Post-Hoc Comparisons for Flag Conditions) reinforced the importance of flag conditions in predicting marathon performance. Red flag conditions, representing the harshest weather, resulted in an average marathon time increase of 10.34 minutes compared to green flag conditions, while yellow flag conditions led to an average increase of 7.69 minutes. These differences were substantial across races, particularly in Duluth, where yellow flag conditions were most frequent.

When evaluating weather impact across age bins, older runners showed the greatest sensitivity to adverse weather. For instance, in the 65+ group, marathon times were significantly slower under red and yellow flag conditions, while younger age groups (such as 18-25) showed less variation in their times across flag categories (Figure 5). This difference highlights that flag conditions, particularly red and yellow flags, have a much more pronounced effect on older runners than on their younger counterparts.

In summary, Aim 3 demonstrated that WBGT and flag conditions had the most significant impacts on marathon performance. While the correlations were relatively modest, the substantial increases in marathon times under more severe flag conditions, particularly for older runners, confirmed the importance of WBGT as the key continuous variable and flag conditions as the primary categorical measure of weather impact.

# Discussion and Conclusion

This study aimed to investigate the effects of age, gender, and environmental factors on marathon performance, revealing how these variables interplay in endurance running. The findings underscore that marathon performance is influenced by age, with gender differences becoming more pronounced as runners age. Additionally, weather conditions play a substantial role in shaping outcomes, particularly under harsher environmental conditions.

Age and Gender Differences (Aim 1) In terms of age and gender differences, the data revealed that both men and women experience a decline in marathon performance as they age, but the timing and rate of decline differ between the sexes. Women tend to reach their peak performance in their late 20s to early 30s, while men generally maintain faster times slightly longer, with their peak around the early 30s. After these peak years, both men and women show a gradual decline in performance, but the rate of decline is sharper in women, particularly in the 65+ age group (Figure 1).

The ANOVA results showed statistically significant interactions between age, sex, and flag conditions, indicating that these factors together influence marathon performance (Table: ANOVA Results for Marathon Times by Flag Condition, Gender, and Age Bin). Furthermore, Tukey Post-Hoc tests demonstrated clear performance differences across various age groups, with younger runners significantly outperforming older ones (Table: Tukey Post-Hoc Test Results for Age Bins). These results align with the hypothesis that aging affects men and women differently, especially under challenging conditions.

Impact of Environmental Conditions (Aim 2) In Aim 2, we examined the effects of environmental conditions on performance, particularly in how these effects vary across age and gender. The results revealed that environmental stress, as measured by WBGT and flag conditions, disproportionately impacts older runners. Figure 5 illustrates that older runners (65+) face substantial performance drops under red flag and yellow flag conditions, while younger runners exhibit more resilience. For example, under red flags, older runners in the 65+ group had marathon times approximately 10 minutes slower compared to younger runners (18-35) (Figure 5).

Additionally, the Duluth (Grandmaâ€™s) marathon, held in the summer, faced harsher environmental conditions, with an average WBGT of 18.65Â°C and 50% of races conducted under yellow flag conditions. This contrasts with marathons like Boston, held in the spring, where milder conditions (WBGT averaging 11.32Â°C) prevailed (Table: Marathon Dates with Average WBGT and Runner Count). These seasonal differences underscore the significance of race timing in relation to environmental stress, particularly in extreme heat.

Key Weather Parameters (Aim 3) In Aim 3, we focused on identifying which weather variables most strongly impact performance. WBGT emerged as the key continuous variable associated with marathon times, though its correlation with performance was relatively weak across races (Figure 3). The strongest WBGT correlations were seen in Boston and Chicago, with values around 0.10, suggesting that while weather does affect performance, its overall impact is modest.

Categorical measures, specifically flag conditions, had a more noticeable effect. The Tukey Post-Hoc Comparisons for Flag Conditions (Table: Tukey Post-Hoc Comparisons for Flag Conditions) showed that red flag conditions led to marathon time increases of over 10 minutes compared to green flags. Similarly, yellow flags resulted in a 7.69-minute increase in marathon times. These findings highlight the utility of flag conditions as a clear, actionable tool for evaluating the impact of weather on performance, particularly under extreme conditions.

The shift toward using flag conditions alongside WBGT reflects the need for both continuous and categorical weather measures. While WBGT provides a quantitative assessment of heat stress, flag conditions offer an easy-to-interpret metric that helps runners and organizers anticipate performance impacts and adjust strategies accordingly.
